# PHOTO_EDITING
Photo editing (also called post-processing) is the process, in digital photography, of making adjustments to 
photographs in a photo editing program.
• Filter Lab provides an easy-to-use user interface which allows you to quickly edit images. 
• It allows the user to perform various operations such as color correction by using different color enhancement 
methods like contrast enhancing, contour, etc., Image flipping by flipping an image at horizontal or vertical 
axis, Image blurring, Image rotation etc.
• In Filter Lab, we have used Pillow(PIL) module to format and filter images.
• We have used Tkinter module for the front-end portion to display the updating photo and various widgets 
like buttons, scale, comboboxes etc.
